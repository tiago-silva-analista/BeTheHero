# Welcome to "Be the Hero" Project! 
The project name is based as a opportunity that the user has to be a hero for someone performing a donation to help some animal that needs to be treated.

This is a project created according to Omnistack Week project, this is a kind of week course that will enable the students to learn the best way to code and features from **React** and **node** languages.

The final result will be an app to connect people with ONGS to perform donations.

#Node.js #ReactJS #React-Native

## Structure

We are using **React** and **React Native** in the Front End and **Node JS** in the Back End. We have created a structure that enable us to connect any kind of Front End code to our back end.

We are using **axios** to perform the **requests** from the client to the Node JS. 

For the database we are using the **KNEX** query builder based on **SQLite3** to create our schema database and execute the database commands.
